A modest dark cave in a eerie snowland marks the entrance to this dungeon| Beyond the dark cave lies a grand, weary room| It's covered in dead vermin, bat droppings and large bones. 
A large granite door in a foggy mountain top marks the entrance to this dungeon| Beyond the granite door lies a scanty, worn room. It's covered in crawling insects, crawling insects and remains| Your torch allows you to see remnants of statues, weathered and dismantled by time itself.
A massive broken statue in a overcast mountain range marks the entrance to this dungeon| Beyond the broken statue lies a grand, ragged room| It's covered in broken pottery, broken pottery and cobwebs.
A short fallen temple in a shadowy grove marks the entrance to this dungeon| Beyond the fallen temple lies a narrow, putrid room| It's covered in crawling insects, bat droppings and moss.
